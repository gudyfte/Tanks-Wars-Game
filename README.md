This game is developed in Java. This game is about two players control two tanks to fire each other on the same computer keyboard.

In the first github repository, I provided six java files which were called tanksGame.java, TankBullet.java, MapBackground.java, Walls.java, DrawWalls.java, and Tank.java. These six java files were saved in the TanksGame folder. The tanksGame class provided main function which could compile the program for the tank game. There were other two java files, which were called KeyboardControl.java and KeyboardEvents.java, were saved in the TanksGame/GameKeyControl folder. There were many png files and wav files which were saved in the TanksGame/Pictures folder. These png files and wav files were used in the tanksGame code. The implementation of tanksGame was to upload png files, upload wav files, place images on the game screen, and compile and execute the program for this game.

The program can be compiled and executed on the command prompt.
